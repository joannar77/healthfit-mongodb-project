### Deliverables & Outcomes
- **Problem–Mission Fit:** Defines data silos and scale constraints and connects them to HealthFit’s mission and product goals.
- **Requirements & Architecture Rationale:** Justifies a document-oriented design (MongoDB) for schema flexibility, sharding, and real-time workloads.
- **Risk & Compliance Controls:** Specifies HIPAA/GDPR guardrails, RBAC, encryption, and auditability.
- **Operational Impact:** Lowers latency for alerts/analytics and scales with high-velocity device data and multi-tenant growth.
